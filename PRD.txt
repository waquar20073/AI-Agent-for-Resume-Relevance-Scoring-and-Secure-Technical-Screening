PROJECT DETAILS:  
 
• Project Objective:  
AI Agent for Resume Relevance Scoring and Secure Technical Screening in Data Science & 
Agentic AI Roles 
To design and prototype an AI-driven recruitment agent that automates early-stage hiring for Data 
Science and Agentic AI roles by: 
1. Scoring candidate resumes for relevance and role fit, and 
2. Conducting a secure, autonomous technical interview that dynamically adapts to candidate 
responses while enforcing compliance and preventing cheating. 
The project will ensure fairness, transparency, and data integrity through built-in AI compliance 
checks, proctoring features, and ethical AI governance. 
 
• Project Description:  
This project builds a secure, compliance-aware AI agent that mimics the role of a recruiter and 
interviewer for technical roles. The agent operates through two interconnected modules: 
Module 1 – Resume Relevance Scoring 
• Parse candidate resumes and job descriptions using natural language processing and semantic 
similarity models (e.g., BERT, OpenAI embeddings). 
• Evaluate alignment on core data science and AI-agentic competencies — e.g., statistics, ML 
algorithms, Python, LLMs, and AI workflow automation. 
• Output a Relevance Score (0–100) and generate a transparent explanation of skills matched, 
missing, or underrepresented. 
• Include a Compliance Layer that ensures: 
o No bias or exclusion based on protected attributes (gender, age, religion, etc.). 
o Explainability for every decision (traceable skill-based reasoning). 
o Data privacy adherence (no exposure of PII) 
Module 2 – Secure AI Technical Screening Interview 
• Conducts a chat-based or voice-based autonomous technical interview without human 
intervention. 
  
                                                                                                                                                       
 
   
 
• Uses a question bank with tagged topics and difficulty levels across: 
o Data science, statistics, ML, and Python 
o Deep learning, transformers, LLMs 
o Agentic AI systems (prompt chaining, reasoning, multi-agent coordination) 
• Dynamically adapts difficulty based on candidate answers. 
• Evaluates candidate responses through LLM-based grading rubrics, code validation, or 
correctness scoring. 
• Generates a structured Interview Report including: 
o Sub-scores per domain 
o Overall technical readiness score 
o Qualitative feedback summary 
o Compliance and integrity flags (if applicable) 
Compliance & Anti-Cheating Mechanisms: 
To ensure fair, transparent, and tamper-proof assessments, the system will include: 
1. AI Compliance Engine: 
o Pre-checks generated questions for bias, sensitive content, or regulatory violations. 
o Ensures fairness by excluding demographic or personal identifiers from scoring logic. 
o Logs every decision for post-hoc auditability. 
2. Candidate Authentication: 
o One-time token-based login or face snapshot verification (synthetic simulation in 
prototype). 
3. Cheat Prevention Controls: 
o Real-time browser and keystroke activity monitoring (simulated). 
o Randomized question sequencing and timing constraints. 
o Detection of copy–paste or external assistance via anomaly detection on response 
patterns. 
4. Interview Integrity Dashboard: 
o Displays compliance score, integrity flags, and audit logs to recruiters. 
5. Privacy & Ethical Governance: 
o Use of synthetic or anonymized candidate profiles only. 
o Clear disclosure of AI-driven evaluation at interview start. 
o Option for candidate feedback or clarification on scoring. 
• Project Scope: 
o Target Roles: Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Agentic AI Developer 
o Data: Only anonymized or synthetic resumes and job descriptions. 
o Channels: Web-based text/voice chat simulation for interviews. 
o Ethics & Fairness: Strict adherence to AI governance principles; protected attributes 
excluded. 
o Output: Relevance scores, interview transcripts, evaluation summaries, and compliance 
logs. 
o Deliverable Level: Functional prototype with compliance and integrity simulation; not 
deployed in live hiring. 
  
                                                                                                                                                       
 
   
 
 
• Project Deliverables: 
o Architecture Document — end-to-end system workflow (input validation → resume 
scoring → interview → compliance checks). 
o Resume Scoring Engine — NLP-based skill extraction and role-match scoring module. 
o Adaptive Interview Module — dynamic question logic, scoring rubric, and transcript 
summarization. 
o Compliance & Integrity Layer — anti-bias filters, cheat detection logic, and audit logging. 
o Technical Question Bank — curated dataset for Data Science and Agentic AI topics. 
o Prototype Interface — demo of full flow (resume upload → scoring → secure AI interview 
→ report). 
o Evaluation & Compliance Report — metrics on accuracy, bias, explainability, and cheating 
prevention effectiveness. 
o Final Presentation — demonstration, ethical review, and roadmap for enterprise 
integration.
